# Synthetic-Data-Generation
A subborn & lightweight (for Python at least) one-file pipeline for synthetic data generation. Currently only supports the Alpaca format, but there are plans to roll out versions for other (often-used) JSON formats.  
Example datasets generated using this repo:  
[XeTute/Islam](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeTute/Islam) | [XeTute/Pakistani-Developer](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeTute/Pakistani-Developer) | [XeTute/Tiny-Eastern-Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XeTute/Tiny-Eastern-Alpaca)  
If you also published one generated with this script and want it to appear here, just open an issue ;)

## Getting started
First, download the `main.py` file from this repo. If you don't trust it, please just read the code, it's nothing too complex.  
We also need to install one dependency which may not be pre-installed, the others are most likely shipped with Python:  
```cmd
pip install requests
```
After completing all steps above, simply go to the directory where you stored the `main.py` file, and execute it:
```cmd
python main.py
```
And that's it! Here's an example usage:
```cmd
Enter the OpenAI-Compatible completions endpoint link (or /v1/chat/completions/-compatible): https://ai.xetute.com/v1/chat/completions
Enter your API key: 0
Only one model available. Auto-selected: koboldcpp/EN_ZH-7B-iQ4
How many samples do you need? 1024
Enter topics (examples: Questions about STEM, Greetings(\"Hi\", \"Sup\"), et cetera): Questions about the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, STEM questions, advanced maths problem questions, Islam
Enter system prompt (leave empty for none): You are a helpful AI assistant.
How many k context length does your endpoint support? 7
```
And that should do the work. If one request fails, the script will automatically retry till it gets a valid response from the server.
